# pyCloudWatcher
## What ?
This project aims at offering a native Python SDK for the CloudWatcher weather station by Lunatico Astro:

https://eu.lunaticoastro.com/product/aag-cloudwatcher-hydreon-rain-sensor-version/

The technical documentation can be found at:

https://lunaticoastro.com/aag-cloud-watcher/moreinfo/

Particularly, the protocol description is in the section called "Information for developers / integrators" (bottom right corner).

I can only recommend LunaticoAstro. Their staff is super friendly and responsive; even for technical questions around the CloudWatcher serial protocol (yes, they do support the hardcore stuff).

I will likely purchase their Pocket CW as it supports the same API as the stationary CloudWatcher. If you happen to have a PocketCW to test with, please report feedback.

Please note: I do not have a CW unit with the capacitive rain sensor. Mine has the hydreon. I can't test anything around these sensors and related parameters.
